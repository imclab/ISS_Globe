# ISS Globe!!

From Science Hack Day San Fransisco 2011.

## What it is

A small group of science hackes put together enought hardware and software to 
track the International Space Station on a real, physical globe.

## Science Hack Day

A small group of us started at science hack day SF with just the idea of somehow 
drawing the real time position of the space station on a physical representation 
of the Earth.

We had 24 hours to come up with a plan and build everthing. We figured out how 
to get two off the shelf servos to position a laser pointer inside an old 
translucent plastic globe.

# This Repository

This has the arduino project (Firmware/ISS_Globe) that acts as a motor 
controller and the python code (Client) to track the ISS and send data to the 
microcontroller that drives the servos.
